## In-Context Video Generalist 

## Key Idea 

Following [IC-Lora](https://github.com/ali-vilab/In-Context-LoRA), we directly concatenate both condition and target videos into a single composite video from spacial or time dimension while using natural language to define the task.
It can serve as a general framework for control video generation, with task-specific fine-tuning.
